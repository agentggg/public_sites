# Meta Image Folder

This folder contains the image used for the **meta image section** of the website.

## Rules
- The image **must be named** `meta.png`.
- Only **one image** should exist in this folder at a time.

## Important
**DO NOT** update the image in place, as this will delete the existing file.  
Instead, follow these steps:

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**.
2. Click **"Open in Finder"** (or File Explorer on Windows).
3. Replace the image by renaming your new image to `meta.png` **before** copying it into the folder.
4. Push the changes via GitHub Desktop.

This ensures the image is safely updated in GitHub without accidental deletion.
