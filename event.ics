DESCRIPTION:You are here for a reason! God did not create you to merely sit at home, binge-watch Netflix, go to work, and return home. You have a God-given destiny that is crucial in this time and age. This is your confirmation: you are called to lead the lost to Christ. Join us at the designated address, where we will pray for you and with you, as well as for those who are lost and trapped in the world. Remember, you are a Champion in Jesus' name, and God WILL accomplish GREAT things through you during your time on this earth, in Jesus' name! \n\n https://youtu.be/N1GJKs7Ur8E?si=sLLdUKPyNNHD6svb
